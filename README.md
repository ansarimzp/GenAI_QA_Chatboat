# 🤖 GenAI Q&A Chatbot System

This repository hosts an intelligent and scalable **Question-Answering (QA) chatbot system** that combines the strengths of **transformer-based models** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to provide context-aware, accurate responses to natural language queries.

Designed for real-world applications in customer service, knowledge bases, education, and enterprise automation, this project seamlessly integrates deep learning with vector search to achieve high performance and reliability.

## 🔍 Why This Project?

Modern NLP models alone aren't enough — they need grounding in real-world data. Our hybrid solution:

- Leverages **fine-tuned BERT** for precise answer extraction
- Uses **FAISS** and **sentence embeddings** for semantic similarity search
- Implements **FastAPI** and optionally **Streamlit** for real-time, user-friendly deployment
- Offers **performance boosts** with model quantization

> The result? A production-ready QA system that's both **intelligent and efficient**.

## 🔧 Performance Optimization

- ✅ **Model Quantization** using `torch.quantization` to reduce memory and boost speed
- ⚡ **FAISS-based Retrieval** for sub-second document search
- ♻️ **Context Caching** and **batched tokenization** to reduce compute time

---

## 🧪 Customize with Your Data

You can fine-tune the system to your domain:

1. Prepare a JSON dataset:
```json
[
  {
    "context": "Tesla was founded in 2003 by engineers...",
    "question": "When was Tesla founded?",
    "answer": "2003"
  }
]
```

2. Fine-tune:
```bash
python src/fine_tune.py --data_path ./data/your_dataset.json
```

3. Re-index:
```bash
python src/create_faiss_index.py --data_path ./data/your_dataset.json
```
